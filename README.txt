Moodle Block "Open Courses"
Author: Stefan Weber, FH Technikum Wien - webers@technikum-wien.at

A tiny block that displays all courses a user can view but is not enrolled in (typically those are courses with open guest access).

For administrators, it just displays a message, since admins can view all courses anyways.
